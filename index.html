  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <div class="max-w-7xl pb-10 px-3 sm:px-5 mx-auto">
    <h1>Project overview</h1>
    <p>Some of you may know of our tenacious journey to reduce emissions created from food waste in landfills, and our
      passion for regenerating our soils.</p>
    <p>Now in our 4th year collecting and processing kitchen waste in Nelson, we've diverted and upcycled over 300
      tonnes of food scraps from landfill into quality, living compost. We have a growing customer base of over 120
      ongoing collection contracts and we've built a strong and diverse community around our weekly educational
      initiative “Compost Club”.</p>
    <p>Scaling up this operation is both essential and an enormous challenge. We built our first automated composting
      machine prototype called bEartha to run Nelson City Council's food waste collection trial in 2020. This was so
      successful that the Ministry for Environment and Nelson City Council offered us grants to help us further develop
      our design. 2 years later, after hundreds of hours designing and engineering, bEartha v2 is finally complete.</p>
    <p>With the perfect operation site now secured in Nelson CBD, we're ready to build Nelson's first automated food
      waste composting facility. While bEartha takes care of the bulk of the composting process, we need funds to
      install her and build the supporting infrastructure needed to run the operation.</p>
    <p>The completion of this facility will see us increase our intake capacity by 3 tonnes per week, create 6 part time
      jobs and a strong foundation for us to continue expanding from.</p>
    <p>With your support we will be able to build our first facility without creating a large amount of debt. We have
      never asked for help like this - but now we need you, your activism and your generosity to get us across the line.
      Thank you for considering supporting this project.</p>

  <!-- What is bEartha? -->
  <div class="max-w-7xl pb-10 px-3 sm:px-5 mx-auto">
    <h1>What is bEartha?</h1>
    <p>bEartha is our in-vessel composting machine designed and built right here in Nelson, New Zealand. The primary
      purpose of bEartha is to make our hot composting process more automated and efficient. bEartha does this by
      continuously monitoring the compost temperature with sensors, and automating the turning of the compost with an
      electric motor and mixer when the highest optimal temperature is reached. This re-oxygenates and optimises the
      conditions for the micro-organisms doing the decomposition.</p>
    <p>bEartha also captures the methane produced by the composting process using a biofilter, reducing both emissions
      and odours. Being contained “in-vessel”, bEartha also eliminates any chance of the compost attracting pests such
      as rats and mice. These features make her a great solution for composting in the same urban environments that the
      kitchen waste is collected from, reducing transportation requirements. Being modular, bEartha facilities can scale
      to any demand, then localised and distributed as required.</p>
    <p>bEartha is unique among similar machines in many ways - for example, she responds dynamically to temperature
      conditions rather than just running on a scheduled timer, although she can do that too. We've also built an app to
      monitor and control bEartha remotely, and analyse and act on insights available from extensive data reporting.
      We're also continually working to make bEartha as affordable as possible and plan on open sourcing the designs and
      code in the future to help achieve this.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- A brief history of bEartha -->
  <div class="max-w-7xl pb-10 px-3 sm:px-5 mx-auto">
    <h1>A brief history of bEartha</h1>
    <h2>bEartha v1</h2>
    <p>Out of necessity to scale our composting operations and very little financial resources, we built bEartha v1 in
      2019 on a shoestring budget, from a 25 year old 20,000 litre steel tank reclaimed from a vineyard. We pieced
      together second hand motors and other bits of hardware, largely with the time and skill sets we had available in
      our immediate community - Ben Bushell had applicable experience and knowledge in manufacturing, Matt Clements was
      completing his apprenticeship as an industrial electrician, Shea Dawson had applicable skills in software
      development and Cristian Ciente, a retired electrical engineer with a lifetime of great experience took us under
      his wings.</p>
    <p class="mb-10">We learned a lot from this process and pushed the limits of what we could achieve by ourselves to
      the absolute edge. </p>

    <h2>bEartha v2</h2>
    <p>We are extremely grateful to have received grants to build bEartha 2, which afforded us the opportunity to
      contract out the heavy engineering work to the experts. After a long process trying to find a contractor that was
      up to the task, we were very happy to partner with Kernohan Engineering who have helped us dramatically improve
      bEartha from design through to build.</p>
    <p>As a result, bEartha's design has had a complete overhaul. bEartha 2 is now fully contained inside a shipping
      container which makes her very safe to work around and extremely portable.</p>
    <p>Our software and electrical systems have been radically upgraded from bEartha 1's DIY microcontroller and PCB
      prototype board to a rock solid set of industrial grade controller, sensor and networking components, including a
      PLC running a full Linux OS. This gives us the opportunity to run more complex software while also guaranteeing a
      high level of safety and reliability.</p>

  <div class="max-w-7xl pb-10 px-3 sm:px-5 mx-auto">
    <h1>What do you need $42,000 for?</h1>

    <!-- Auger/shredder -->
    <h2>1. Auger/shredder to efficiently load material into bEartha</h2>
    <p>If you watched the video above, you would have seen how much labour was required to load bEartha v1 by hand. This
      is a major bottleneck in our current operations. An enclosed auger/feeder that carries food waste from our
      shredder unit directly into bEartha will radically improve efficiency and reduce the amount of exposure the team
      has to raw food waste, which let's face it - is not the most pleasant material to be working with for hours on
      end! We have had an epic auger manufactured, we now just need to pay for it to be connected to bEartha and adapt
      our shredder to feed it.</p>
    <h3>What's involved?</h3>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Adapt our shredder to connect to the auger</li>
      <li>Integrate the auger to bEartha</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="font-bold">Cost: $18,000.00</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- Electrical Installation -->
    <h2>2. Electrical Installation</h2>
    <p>bEartha requires a 3-phase power supply installed at our new site, to run her electric motor, the shredder motor,
      and the extractor fan motor. This has turned out to be fairly expensive due to the installation requiring us to
      cut into asbestos around the current power board, and run the 3 phase cable 20 metres from the mains board through
      the building, and 25 metres underground across the yard.</p>
    <p>There are also extra costs involved in ensuring our installation satisfies regulatory requirements.</p>
    <h3>What's involved?</h3>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Install 3-phase electrical supply to the facility site</li>
      <li>Purchase 45 metres of 10mm 5 core, mechanically protected electrical cable</li>
      <li>Run cable through the building and trench</li>
      <li>Purchase and install upgraded breaker board with check metre</li>
      <li>Purchase and install industrial rated connections and emergency stop fittings</li>
      <li>Electrical testing and Industrial sign-off</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="font-bold">Cost: $9,000.00</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- Enclosed processing area to operate within -->
    <h2>3. Enclosed processing area to operate within</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges we had running bEartha 1 was working outside in all weather conditions.</p>
    <p>There are many tasks for the team to complete: we open the collected bins of food waste, sort for contaminants,
      run the food waste through a shredder, load it into the machine and wash the emptied collection buckets, all of
      which we have been doing in the open and under flood lights during the winter.</p>
    <p>Whilst Nelson has great weather, we need the security of a protected space.</p>
    <p>A cost effective solution for our new facility is a 12m x 6m marquee so that we can perform the above tasks in an
      enclosed environment. The marquee will be customised to connect with bEartha’s feed auger, and fan unit to extract
      odours for those working inside.</p>
    <h3>What's involved?</h3>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Purchase marquee</li>
      <li>Installation and Customisation to integrate with bEartha</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="font-bold">Cost: $3,000.00</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- Washing up -->
    <h2>4. Washing up station, toilet, plumbing</h2>
    <p>If you’ve ever been to the Compost Club on a Saturday morning, you’ll know that washing up is almost half of our
      work. With our new facility designed to process the waste streams from 400 businesses and homes, we need to
      optimise this critical process for safety and efficiency.</p>
    <h3>What's involved?</h3>
    <ul class="disc">
      <li>Connection to mains water supply and sewerage</li>
      <li>Materials, fittings and trenching of pipes onsite</li>
      <li>Install taps, grates, drains and toilet</li>
      <li>Purchase and install gas califont for hot water</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="font-bold">Cost: $6,000.00</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- Contingency -->
    <h2>5. Contingency</h2>
    <p>We're allocating around 10% of this project's budget to cover any unforseen costs that inevitably arise in
      complex project like this.</p>
    <p class="font-bold">Cost: $4,000.00</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- Givealittle fees -->
    <h2>6. Givealittle fees</h2>
    <p>Givealittle charges a 5% fee on all contributions to our campaign. If our campaign is successful, we would incur
      around $2,000 worth of fees.</p>
    <p class="font-bold">Cost: $2,000.00</p>

    <h1>Risks and Assumptions</h1>
    <h2>Dependency on thrid parties</h2>
    <p>To meet our milestone goals, we are dependent on circumstances aligning for multiple 3rd parties to complete
      tasks on time. We need the site landlord to move his shipping containers, we need the engineers to have
      availability to deliver bEartha from the workshop, and various contractors like Lift and Shift, electricians and
      plumbers to fit with our schedule, too. </p>
    <p>We’ve done everything we can to orchestrate all of this but also recognise that we are depending on others whose
      capacities are likely impacted to some degree by covid and flood affected supply chains and services. Any delays
      or changes to our timing will be announced in our weekly updates to those who contributed to this campaign. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Finances</h2>
    <p>While we’ve done our best to accurately budget for this project, our experience is that unexpected costs are… to
      be expected. We currently have a private loan which we are using to fund much of this project’s expenses up front.
      If we raise our goal of $42k through this campaign, we can have everything paid for and be clear of debt. In the
      case of extra costs and/or falling short of our fundraising goals, we will extend the loan to complete the
      project. With interest rates on the rise we would really like to avoid that, so thank you again for any support
      you can offer.</p>
